# Description

My front-end project that connects with my back-end API project (listed above) from my time on the Northcoders bootcamp. It is a 'reddit inspired' platform where you can post and read reviews of board games. You can comment, vote and write your own reviews. It was built using React.js and styled with mostly Vanilla CSS and React UI frameworks.
